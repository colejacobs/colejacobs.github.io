<DIV>Favorite team: New England Patriots</DIV>


<P>Hello <I>Welcome to my football page</I>. Here you will find my weekly recaps of the
top NFL teams in the current season.</P>

<head><b> New England Patriots(9-2):</b></head>
<P>Defeated the New York Jets 22-17. Not a great game for either team, 
but great the Pats were able to win an away game against a team that
always has a chance to beat them. </P>

<head><b> Dallas Cowboys (10-1):</b></head>
<P> The rookie duo, Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliot defeat the Redskins
31-26. Even though Redskins QB, Kirk Cousins threw for 449 yards and 3 touchdowns,
Dallas was able to come out with another BIG win against a solid playoff caliber team. </P>

<head><b> Oakland Raiders (9-2):</b></head>
<p> Defeated the Carolina Panthers 35-32. First of all, great game to watch. Both QBs
threw for a couple touchdowns and both RBs got in the endzone. The Raiders keep finding 
ways to win football games and are a great team to watch this season. As a Pats fan I am
nervous to seem them in the playoffs. </P>
