<P>Hello world. <I>Welcome to my homepage</I>. I am 18 years old and from Wayland, MA. I am attending UMaine and currently majoring in business. I prefer spending my free time <a href= "skiing.html">skiing</a>, running, and <a href= "hiking.html">hiking</a>. Skiing is probably my favorite thing to do, I have been out west to Utah and Colorado. Utah was great because in Salt Lake City every ski resort is within a half hour of you. I shared a photo below of me on top of Little Cottonwood Canyon at Snowbird Ski Resort. I also enjoy listening to music, watching <a href="football.html">football</a>, hanging out with friends, and relaxing. My favorite football team is the New England Patriots, but I enjoy watching all teams play and I follow football closely. On my personal website you can follow my interests and activities I enjoy. Thanks for checking out my personal website! </p>
